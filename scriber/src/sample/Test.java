                "But these scientists say their ULTRA-white paint could make those rooves even cooler.\n" +
                "While the whitest currently available paints reflect between 80 and 90 per cent of sunlight, these researchers say theirs reflects more than 98 per cent.\n" +
                "Covering a 1,000 square foot [92.9 square metre] roof with this paint, they estimate, would provide more cooling power than a typical central air conditioner.\n" +

                "Every one per cent of reflectance that you get will translate to 10 watts per metre squared less heating from the Sun. So, basically, it provides cooling of 18 kilowatts. That's really a big deal. That's more than a typical air conditioner does for a house with the same kind of space.\n" +
